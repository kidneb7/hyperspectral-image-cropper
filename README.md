# hyperspectral-image-cropper

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
A simple Python tool based on [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and [Spectral Python (SPy)](http://www.spectralpython.net/) for cropping datacubes of hyperspectral images.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

#### Setting up the environment
Using Anaconda, run

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

from the repository root folder.

#### Crop hyperspectral cubes
From the repository root folder, run

```bash
python3 roi.py -f path_to_hyperspectral_file.hdr -m
```

to crop multiple regions of interest from `path_to_hyperspectral_file.hdr`. Before each crop, specify the name of the cropped file without file extension. Then in the OpenCV window, select ROI and confirm with `SPACE` or `ENTER`. Both a hyperspectral cube (`.hdr`) and an RGB preview (`.png`) will be saved to the `data/outputs/`  directory.

> Omitting `-m` disables multiple crops and the output will be saved as `cropped.hdr`.

## :camera: Example data
Example data is provided by [Professor Lise Lyngsnes Randeberg](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/lise.randeberg) at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu). Various pharmaceuticals were captured over 256 bands in the SWIR range using a [HySpex (NEO)](https://hyspex.com) hyperspectral camera. It is possible to identify the pharmaceuticals from their reflection spectrums.
